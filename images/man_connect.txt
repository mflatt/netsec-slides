CONNECT(2)                                  System Calls Manual                                 CONNECT(2)

NAME
     connect â€“ initiate a connection on a socket

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);

DESCRIPTION
     The parameter socket is a socket.  If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM, this call specifies the peer with
     which the socket is to be associated; this address is that to which datagrams are to be sent, and the
     only address from which datagrams are to be received.  If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, this
     call attempts to make a connection to another socket.  The other socket is specified by address,
     which is an address in the communications space of the socket.

     Each communications space interprets the address parameter in its own way.  Generally, stream sockets
     may successfully connect() only once; datagram sockets may use connect() multiple times to change
     their association.  Datagram sockets may dissolve the association by calling disconnectx(2), or by
     connecting to an invalid address, such as a null address or an address with the address family set to
     AF_UNSPEC (the error EAFNOSUPPORT will be harmlessly returned).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and the
     global integer variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The connect() system call will fail if:

     [EACCES]           The destination address is a broadcast address and the socket option SO_BROADCAST
                        is not set.

     [EADDRINUSE]       The address is already in use.

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    The specified address is not available on this machine.

     [EAFNOSUPPORT]     Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.
