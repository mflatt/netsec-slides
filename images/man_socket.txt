SOCKET(2)                                   System Calls Manual                                  SOCKET(2)

NAME
     socket – create an endpoint for communication

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
     socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor.

     The domain parameter specifies a communications domain within which communication will take place;
     this selects the protocol family which should be used.  These families are defined in the include
     file ⟨sys/socket.h⟩.  The currently understood formats are

           PF_LOCAL        Host-internal protocols, formerly called PF_UNIX,
           PF_UNIX         Host-internal protocols, deprecated, use PF_LOCAL,
           PF_INET         Internet version 4 protocols,
           PF_ROUTE        Internal Routing protocol,
           PF_KEY          Internal key-management function,
           PF_INET6        Internet version 6 protocols,
           PF_SYSTEM       System domain,
           PF_NDRV         Raw access to network device,
           PF_VSOCK        VM Sockets protocols

     The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the semantics of communication.  Currently defined
     types are:

           SOCK_STREAM
           SOCK_DGRAM
           SOCK_RAW

     A SOCK_STREAM type provides sequenced, reliable, two-way connection based byte streams.  An out-of-
     band data transmission mechanism may be supported.  A SOCK_DGRAM socket supports datagrams
     (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length).  SOCK_RAW sockets
     provide access to internal network protocols and interfaces.  The type SOCK_RAW, which is available
     only to the super-user.
